=======================================================================================================================================/

	1. connect to Visual Studio online server
		https://akiradevwavelength.visualstudio.com/_git/Barium
		(to do this, we need a account of visualstudio.com, which might be made as "username@akirasystems.com")
	2. connect to SharePoint
		we have 2 url addresses for SharePoint, one is for Central Administration, the other is for Barium.
			(need to make sure)In my opinion, using connection with Central Administration we can create a new account for connection to SharePoint, and using new individual account, we can connect to the SharePoint for our solution.
	3. using Git, getting the source codes (from https://akirawavelength.visualstudio.com/_git/Barium)
		- install 'TortoiseGit'
		- copy the url address of the source from 'https://akirawavelength.visualstudio.com/_git/Barium', clicking 'Clone'
		- at the 'C:\Git', 		
			. right click, and select 'Git Clone...'
			. paste url address of the source to URL:
			. make sure the Directory: is your local directory which you want like 'C:\Git\Barium'
		(if you complete these things, that means you have the last version of the source codes.)
	4. create new branch using TortoiseGit
		- This can  
			make sure what you are doing and have done.
			prevent to update your changes to 'master' on the server. 
		- recommended convention rules is initial-#ofTicket(-description) like "bj-7545-createDYK"
		- recommended to check the check-box of 'Switch to new branch' (then you don't need to switch again because TortoiseGit switch your branch automatically)
	5. make changes in source codes
		- Visual Studio Solution (Run as administrator)
			1. for UI: Barium.Boost.sin  	(C:\Git\Barium\Source\Barium.Boost)
			2. for Backend: Barium.sln		(C:\Git\Barium\Source\Barium)
				input the URL of SharePoint to make sure the connection with SharePoint like "http://akiradev-017:13377/"
					Barium.Web.Core (SharePoint)
					Barium.Web.Definitions (SharePoint)
					ClarityDashboard (SharePoint)
	6. commit the changes
		- after changing, you can see the red '!' in your file explore
		- right click on your folder, select 'Git commit -> branch name'
			available and necessary to add message for description about changes, and this message will be re-used when you ask to 
	7. push the changes to server
		make sure 
			- the space in 'Remote:', the name of branch in 'Remote:' would be same with your 'Local' branch automatically.
			- the name of branch in 'Local:'
	8. Pull Request
		you can 
			- see the result of your pushing on the menu of 'Branches' on akiradevwavelength.visualstudio.com
			- make pull request to update the change to source
				when you ask pull request, you can modify your orginal description about the changes
	9. Review changes by other developers.
	10. apply the change
